### View State and UI Routing

Explain, in your own words, what a "view state" is, and how it relates to
 front-end frameworks.

```md
A view state is a a state a webpage can be displayed. In the browser history you can see different view states.

A front-end framework makes use of different view states to make the application more efficient. Ember uses view states through HTML templates.
```

### Ember Concepts

What are the essential parts of an Ember 2 application?
What changes have happened between Ember 1 and Ember 2?

```md
1. Routes: URL's for each view
2. Modules: data that are needed for current view
3. Templates: HTML templates similar to Handlebars
4. Components: custom HTML tag
5. Services: holds data for a session of a user

- 'data down, action up'
- refresh everytime something changes
- Add Glimmer rendering engine
```

### Ember in Practice

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
Ember puts more responsibility on the client (validation, processing, redering), which makes the system more efficient

Ember offers a solution for the whole MVC framework and doesnt only focus on the view state.

Ember is flexible and will be changes according to future needs.

```

### Ember and URLs

In your own words, how does Ember "stop breaking the web"?

```md
Ember introduces URL's without "breaking the net". Some people make applications without introducing URL's which makes the application less valuable, since you can't share a spefic view state.


```
