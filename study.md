# Ember Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Before you get started, please read this exerpt from the first section of [a
blog post](http://pragmatic-backbone.com/routing-and-controllers) on
    Backbone's Router:

>"For the vast majority of cases, we want users to navigate through the app, and for the user to be able to go back to the screen they were using the browser history (back/forward buttons). These screens are in reality states of the app: *new book form visible*, *viewing a list of books I own*, *browsing a book*, and so on, are examples of possible states that the UI is in.

>As to what screen changes warrant a state, it depends on how granular you want the user experience to be. For instance, you may decide to show the new book form in place, perhaps right above my list of books, and not have a dedicated URL (or a page) for creating new books. Or maybe there’s a large volume of information to be filled in it and you’d like to avoid cluttering the screen, so it makes more sense for that form to live in a screen of its own.

>The point is that while common sense (and known patterns) will provide great guidelines when it comes to deciding that, without taking UX into consideration, there are no absolutes. Backbone, like Ember or Angular, will give you a tool for creating screen states with URLs. Choosing what's appropriate is up to you and what you're building.

>Hence if and where you choose to have state in your app, you’ll need to use the router for constructing the UI. The low-level logic for doing all that won't live in the router itself of course. Instead, it'll fetch data using models/collections, and it’ll instance and render views to display the data. Put simply: it's with the router that you'll 'assemble' your application where state applies."

## Responses

### View State and UI Routing

Explain, in your own words, what a "view state" is, and how it relates to
 front-end frameworks.

```md
A view state, as best I can understand/tell, is the computer's take on how to update the DOM as changes are made.
```

### Ember Concepts

What are the essential parts of an Ember 2 application?

```md
the ember-cli-build.js that tells ember how to actually put the app together
the app folder, where the actual coe that runs the app is stored

```

### Ember in Practice

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
Honestly, I think a lot of this was cut out of the readings.  My understanding
from what I just studied is that Ember makes the SPA model ring closer to the
old URL patterns of websites (see below).  It's also fast to set up and uses
familiar handlebar-style templates.
```

### Ember and URLs

In your own words, how does Ember "stop breaking the web"?

```md
Ember's route system allows for individual URLs within a web, which makes pages
in the app much more easily accessed and shared.
```
