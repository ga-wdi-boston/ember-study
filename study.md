## Responses

### View State and UI Routing

Explain, in your own words, what a "view state" is, and how it relates to
 front-end frameworks.

```md
The front end framework toggles the state of the view presented to the user.

```

### Ember Concepts

What are the essential parts of an Ember 2 application?
What changes have happened between Ember 1 and Ember 2?

```md
Ember 2 promotes one-way data flow, refreshing when something changes, and the use
of hooks for components.  A big change is the use of the Glimmer rendering engine.
```

### Ember in Practice

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
The whole purpose of Ember is to provide a complete solution when it comes to a
client side app.  It also is meant to be completely backward compatible so that
past, even outdated, innovations are maintained (or supported).
```

### Ember and URLs

In your own words, how does Ember "stop breaking the web"?

```md
Since everything is happening on the client.  The app runs in the user's browser
and is self contained, including everything it needs.  According to Tom Dale in the video we
watched for the study - a web app contains URLS and can be forked and shared.
```
