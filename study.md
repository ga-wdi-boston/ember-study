## Responses

### View State and UI Routing

Explain, in your own words, what a "view state" is, and how it relates to
 front-end frameworks.

```md
A view state is what content is currently being displayed to the user.
```

### Ember Concepts

What are the essential parts of an Ember 2 application?
What changes have happened between Ember 1 and Ember 2?

```md
routes, models, templates, components, and services.
ember 2 made things more simple and stable. they added one way data flow 
which means the data is only sent down and to the client and actions are sent 
up to the server. re-rendering also became better in ember 2. 
```

### Ember in Practice

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
ember is designed to give you strict guidelines but also flexibility.
you would want to use it to give structure to your front end app. 
```

### Ember and URLs

In your own words, how does Ember "stop breaking the web"?

```md
it allows the page to have different urls for the different view states. 
this makes it possible for a user to hit the back button and go back to the
previous view state, despite always being on the same web page. 
```
