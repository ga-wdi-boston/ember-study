### Ember in Practice

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
Ember streamlines the creation of single-page apps by conventionalizing the
development process according to industry best practices. This makes code easier
to create, read, and edit. Similarly to Rails, Ember can quickly generate models,
routes, controllers, serializers, and other high-level tools for creating SPAs.
Handlebars is built-in, so using and presenting server data is relatively simple
in an ember app as well.

One nice note from the video Jeff linked ('Stop Breaking the Web') is that Ember
fits nicely into the MVC architecture of web apps, because its URL-based SPA
architecture (app-name/model/1[view]?sort=controller) mirrors the structure of
MVC.
