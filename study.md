## Why use Ember

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
Someone would use Ember because it is a super powerful framework for building awesome apps.
Stuff that you didn't know you needed is already put into place by Ember. Using Ember CLI you can easily add new parts
to your app and Ember takes care of all the leg work for you. No matter how big your app gets, Embers system makes it easy to
manage and housekeep your codebase and make meaningful edits as easily as when you first implemented a feature.
