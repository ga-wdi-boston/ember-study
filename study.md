### Ember in Practice

```md
So far it seems that ember is pretty close to express and it's generator, but
unlike express using jade, ember seems to be using handlebars as a template engine. Ember also is designed
to have multiple views on one page. Like twitter's site. Ember does have an rails feel to it becuse of the interesting helpers it has in place.
It also gives you the ablility to have a few templates of what you want to be rendered on the page.
The route functionality of ember is very valueable for client applicaitons. They allow for things to be bookedmarked,
and help stop JQuery spaghetti from occuring. They also alow for orgianizing your app.
Ember also has built in generators like rails. Its very quick to get things up and running.
