### Ember in Practice

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
Ember allows for a unified way of dealing with user events. Instead of using Ajax to query your database for information, Ember has its own function that does the same thing with a much more concise and compact syntax.
Ember also closely ties html objects with direct database actions. with much less code being written to acheave a simular action in a typical web application.
