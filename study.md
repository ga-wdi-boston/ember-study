### View State and UI Routing

Explain, in your own words, what a "view state" is, and how it relates to
 front-end frameworks.

```md
a view state could be thought of as a turnstile. there is a locked and a unlocked state.
To me it reminds me of boolean values, like true or false, on or off. It could be if else,
if this is true, do this. Else do this.
```

### Ember Concepts

What are the essential parts of an Ember 2 application?
What changes have happened between Ember 1 and Ember 2?

```

### Ember in Practice

```

Ember fixes the routes to be more modular. It can allow you to nest URL's within one another.
