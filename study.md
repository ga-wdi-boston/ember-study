# Ember Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and

## Required Readings

-   [Ember CLI â€” A command line utility for creating ambitious web applications](http://ember-cli.com/user-guide/)
-   [Ember.js - Guides and Tutorials](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.4.0/) (yes,
    read them all)

Additionally, we highly recommend completing the **entire** [Try
Ember](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ember) course from CodeSchool.

## Why use Ember

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
One would use a frontend javascript framework - like Ember - in order to provide a more
responsive user experience, specifically by allowing for the creation of single-page
applications. One would use Ember in particular because of its ability to provide
the 'complete package' of features and follows 'convention over configuration',
allowing a project to get up, running, and completed quickly. Another perk,
especially for someone with Ruby on Rails experience, is how it mimics Rails
due to its founder's connection with Rails' development. I gather that it takes
awhile to learn everything, but once you do it's a powerful tool for getting a job done well.

I used wikipedia, a site called [Lullabot] (https://www.lullabot.com/articles/choosing-the-right-javascript-framework-for-the-job),
[AirPair](https://www.airpair.com/js/javascript-framework-comparison), and the two readings as my sources.
