### Ember in Practice

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
Ember is a client side MVC javascript framework and that uses convention over configuration.
The decision of choosing what dependencies to be used has already been decided,
there is no need to squabble for hours on what you need from scratch.
Generating templates and models is easy with Ember CLI, like rails just type
a simple command and files are made for you.  Ember also encourages testing it
usually generates test files with templates and other files. What is most
attractive to Ember is the ability to send less request to the server.  Pretty
much cause it is client side MVC it tries to only send data to server and
render what it needs to the client through components.
