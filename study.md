## Why use Ember

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
Ember takes care of a lot of single page application functionality that we had programmed by hand (such as refreshing handlebars). With Ember, whenever a change is made to the data that populates the app, if you set things up right, the change will render immediately. Ember also introduces url functionality into SPAs. This makes for a good user experience (user can bookmark, use the back button, etc) and also allows for easier tracking of site use data (what pages are visited most frequently, how users interact, etc). Ember offers a templating structure similar to Rails, allowing you to get a quick start at building the API.
