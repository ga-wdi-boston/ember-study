### View State and UI Routing

Explain, in your own words, what a "view state" is, and how it relates to
 front-end frameworks.

```md
A view state is what the user sees. When a certain action is taken, a new template is loaded on the view state by using routers and URLs.
```

### Ember Concepts

What are the essential parts of an Ember 2 application?
What changes have happened between Ember 1 and Ember 2?

```md
Routes, Models, Templates, Compnents and Services.

I think the difference between Ember 1 and EMber is is that Ember 2 is lighter.
```

### Ember in Practice

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
One reason to use Ember is to make frontend developing much easier and quicker.
```

### Ember and URLs

In your own words, how does Ember "stop breaking the web"?

```md
All webapps utilize the URL as sort of like a 'pointer' that takes the user to a specific part/view of that app. If a site content change, but the URL stays static throughout every view state, then there is no way that a user can go back to a specific view state without going through every action that brought them to that view initially. 
```
