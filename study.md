## Responses

### View State and UI Routing

Explain, in your own words, what a "view state" is, and how it relates to
 front-end frameworks.

```md
The view state is the current state of what the user is viewing. This is influenced
by user action taken on the page. Front-end frameworks strive to simplify the
process of development of these different states.
```

### Ember Concepts

What are the essential parts of an Ember 2 application?
What changes have happened between Ember 1 and Ember 2?

```md
Routes, models, templates, components, and services are the essential parts.
Ember two added:
- One way data flow by default
- "Just refresh it" when something changes
- Standard lifecycle hooks for components.
```

### Ember in Practice

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
To make their webpages more dynamic and to allow developers to be more productive.
```

### Ember and URLs

In your own words, how does Ember "stop breaking the web"?

```md
Ember allows developers to easily develop SPAs that make use of URLs which is
essential to make your page sharable/bookmarkable/etc. Without URLs the
functionality of the app is greatly limited, and it isn't truly a webpage in
the traditional and useful sense.
```
