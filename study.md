### Ember in Practice

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
Ember is a JavaScript MVC framework with a very established and detailed
documentation. Ember works similarily to rails in that it makes small
choices in the background for you to make programming more seamless. Ember
can detect made changes and will refresh the application automatically. Ember
has handy built in methods including string manipulation using the methods w
and fmt. More built in methods include map, reduced, and filter in order
to effectively deal with arrays. The method mapProperty allows you to pass in
a key of an object and return all values associated to that key. Ember allows
data-binding by using the simple method set. Ember has excellect class
modeling features which makes for much more readable code. Ember has many useful
features including it's router and it's object system. The router provides
URLs and a back button by default with every created route. Ember's object
system take's the best parts of ruby object's and builds right on top of them.
This allows Ember to use mixins. Ember also supports Computed properties
which works as a more powerful Microsoft Excel. There are many
reasons why one would choose to use Ember being all the available built-in
features and the ease of use.
