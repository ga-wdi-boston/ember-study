In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
Ember is a front end framework.  Someone would want to use Ember, or any other frontend framework,
  for many reasons.  One being it helps manage app complexity.  It keeps your app seperated into
  standardized, manangeable files.  It allows there to be structure and consistency, allowing for large apps
  to be maintained for years.
Ember provides a model, view, controller pattern on the front end.  There basic parts of Ember are:
  Routes, each part of the URL has a route object that controls what the user is seeing.
  Models, with each route comes a model.  The model is responsible for the data associated with the current view of the
  application.  Json objects can be loaded from a server and use them, or Ember data can serve this purpose.
  Templates are used to build the HTML.  They are written in a version of handlebars.
  Components are custom HTML tags.  The behavior is implemented with Javascript, and the display is contolled by handlebars
  Lastly services, which are singleton objects that hold data such as user data that is going to be used over and over again.
