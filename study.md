# Ember Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Before you get started, please read this exerpt from the first section of [a
blog post](http://pragmatic-backbone.com/routing-and-controllers) on
    Backbone's Router:

>"For the vast majority of cases, we want users to navigate through the app, and for the user to be able to go back to the screen they were using the browser history (back/forward buttons). These screens are in reality states of the app: *new book form visible*, *viewing a list of books I own*, *browsing a book*, and so on, are examples of possible states that the UI is in.

>As to what screen changes warrant a state, it depends on how granular you want the user experience to be. For instance, you may decide to show the new book form in place, perhaps right above my list of books, and not have a dedicated URL (or a page) for creating new books. Or maybe there’s a large volume of information to be filled in it and you’d like to avoid cluttering the screen, so it makes more sense for that form to live in a screen of its own.

>The point is that while common sense (and known patterns) will provide great guidelines when it comes to deciding that, without taking UX into consideration, there are no absolutes. Backbone, like Ember or Angular, will give you a tool for creating screen states with URLs. Choosing what's appropriate is up to you and what you're building.

>Hence if and where you choose to have state in your app, you’ll need to use the router for constructing the UI. The low-level logic for doing all that won't live in the router itself of course. Instead, it'll fetch data using models/collections, and it’ll instance and render views to display the data. Put simply: it's with the router that you'll 'assemble' your application where state applies."

## Responses

### View State and UI Routing

Explain, in your own words, what a "view state" is, and how it relates to
 front-end frameworks.

```md
A view state is just the state at which people see a page... It's what shows up
on the browser, probably with Handlebars for Ember. It's what responds to user
events.
```

### Ember Concepts

What are the essential parts of an Ember 2 application?

```md
- Routes/URL -- important for letting us share data with other people as opposed to holding all the data locally
- Models -- hold the data we need for the current view-state
- Templates -- help separate concerns when building the HTML
- Components -- custom HTML tag, connects JavaScript behavior to HTMLbars templates
- Services -- keep track of user sessions
```

### Ember in Practice

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
It seems more developer-friendly which is great because we just want to make things
user-friendly, so everyone wins. It focuses more on fixing how we do views, and
it's built to be flexible.
```

### Ember and URLs

In your own words, how does Ember "stop breaking the web"?

```md
It has really good URL support, and it makes nested components easier to manage, and it's easier for other people to deal with because it follows convention. It basically breaks down complicated pages into smaller, separate concerns, so it makes navigation more user-friendly.
```
