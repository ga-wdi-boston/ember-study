## Responses

### View State and UI Routing

Explain, in your own words, what a "view state" is, and how it relates to
 front-end frameworks.

```md
View state keeps all the information in the different sessions (and between devices) constantly updated (real time)
```

### Ember Concepts

What are the essential parts of an Ember 2 application?
What changes have happened between Ember 1 and Ember 2?

```md
Routing, templates, components, controllers, and models.
Views have been replaced with components (there is an add on for backward compatibility), the need for controllers has largely been eliminated, and it is more 'aligned'(compatible) with js.```

### Ember in Practice

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
It has quite a few features which would be very helpful on building your site.  Easy to impliment on
large projects (because it's easy to learn).

```

### Ember and URLs

In your own words, how does Ember "stop breaking the web"?

```md
It makes url navigation clearer and elimantes errors that past SPA's ran into.```
