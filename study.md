### View State and UI Routing

Explain, in your own words, what a "view state" is, and how it relates to
 front-end frameworks.

```md

A view state is a combination of what appears on the client side at any given time: both DOM elements and data. Front end frameworks help manage these states.

### Ember Concepts

What are the essential parts of an Ember 2 application?
What changes have happened between Ember 1 and Ember 2?

```md

Core parts:

- Router (maps URL to route)
- Routes (load a template and a model/data)
- Model (store data on a server or in Local Storage)
- Template (displays data + desired DOM elements for a route)
  - templates in Ember use Handlebars 
- Components (template + behavior defined in a JS file)

Changes in Ember 2 (not all of these were released in Ember 2.0; some may still be in the works):

- Ember 2 removed old/deprecated features and code that had build up in Ember 1. 
- Ember Data became a stable part of Ember.
- Binding data with angle brackets instead of double curly braces. This is part of a "data down, actions up" approach that means templates don't by default update data (data binding is one-way, not two-way).
- Ember 2 uses the Glimmer rendering engine, which rerenders only the parts of a template that have changed. This makes things faster.

### Ember in Practice

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md

Using Ember lets you better organize your code and write a JavaScript app with client-side routing.

```

### Ember and URLs

In your own words, how does Ember "stop breaking the web"?

```md

URLs are critical to the webâ€”for sharing, for bookmarking, etc. JavaScript apps can exist entirely without URLs, and the single-page apps we've built in GA to date only use a single URL, meaning we can't share or link to any specific pieces of the app. Ember (and other front-end frameworks) let us use URLs, restoring this functionality. In particular, Ember uses nested routes to more clearly connect URLs to desired UI/view states.
